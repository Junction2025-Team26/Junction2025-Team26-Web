# 🚀 SyncTank  

**Drop now. Remember later.**  
SyncTank is your **personal AI secretary**.  
On Mac, you can throw in anything — text, screenshots, or files.  
On iPhone, it comes back as reminders and insights.

## ✨ Why SyncTank?  
We all get busy. Ideas slip away, screenshots get buried, and tasks get forgotten.  
SyncTank catches everything for you, so you can stay focused on your work.  

- No more scattered sticky notes  
- No more “I’ll remember this later” (and forgetting)  
- No more switching apps to manage tasks  

Just **drop it now, and let SyncTank handle the rest.**
